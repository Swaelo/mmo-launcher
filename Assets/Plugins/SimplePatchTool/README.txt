1. ABOUT
SimplePatchTool is a C# library for patching standalone applications with binary diff and self patching support.

2. HOW TO
- set "Api Compatibility Level" to .NET 2.0 or higher (i.e. don't use .NET 2.0 Subset) in Edit-Project Settings-Player
- (optional) in Edit-Project Settings-Player, enable "Run In Background" so that SimplePatchTool can continue running while the application is minimized/not focused
- you can now use "Window-Simple Patch Tool" to create/update patches, sign/verify xml files and generate RSA key pair.
